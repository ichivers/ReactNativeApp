# ReactNativeApp
A React Native app with Azure Communication Services Chat

Currently only Android works!  Although no reason that iOS shouldn't.

It will authenticate using a callback at which point the necessary tokens/user id will be passed back.

It's a very rough app, I've had to shelve this project as moved onto other work.  

Hope to revisit it someday, or if Microsoft actually produce a Xamarin or React Native SDK it can be binned.
